Fluency measures the quality of individual sentences in the answer, and whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences when evaluating fluency. Given the question and answer, score the fluency of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale: 

One star: the answer completely lacks fluency 

Two stars: the answer mostly lacks fluency 

Three stars: the answer is partially fluent 

Four stars: the answer is mostly fluent 

Five stars: the answer has perfect fluency 

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
