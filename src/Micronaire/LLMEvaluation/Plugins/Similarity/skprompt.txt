GPT-Similarity, as a metric, measures the similarity between the predicted answer and the correct answer. If the information and content in the predicted answer is similar or equivalent to the correct answer, then the value of the Equivalence metric should be high, else it should be low. Given the question, correct answer, and predicted answer, determine the value of Equivalence metric using the following rating scale: 

One star: the predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer 

Two stars: the predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer 

Three stars: the predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer 

Four stars: the predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer 

Five stars: the predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer 

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
