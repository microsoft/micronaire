Coherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence. Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale: 

One star: the answer completely lacks coherence 

Two stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence 

Three stars: the answer is partially coherent 

Four stars: the answer is mostly coherent 

Five stars: the answer has perfect coherency 

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
